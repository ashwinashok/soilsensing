# ðŸŒ± Soil Sensing

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project focuses on soil sensing using temperature and moisture sensors, integrating Raspberry Pi and Arduino to monitor and analyze soil conditions. The collected data can help in agriculture, research, and automation systems.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure
Here's an overview of the files in this repository (https://github.com/ashwinashok/soilsensing):
